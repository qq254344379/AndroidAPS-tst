/**
 * [PumpStateStore] subclass that uses AndroidAPS' [SP] class for storing the pump state.
 *
 * This pump state has a special logic to address the following problem:
 *
 * What if the user already paired AAPS with a Combo, and then imports and old AAPS settings file, intending to just restore
 * other settings like the basal profile, but does _not_ intend to import an old pump state? After all, the pump state is
 * in the AAPS SP, so the state values will also be written into a settings file when exporting said settings. If we just
 * relied on the imported configuration, the current pump state - including pairing info like the PC and CP keys - would
 * be overwritten with the old ones from the imported settings. If that pump state is from an previous pairing, the user
 * would have to unnecessarily re-pair the Combo every time settings get imported.
 *
 * This pump state store has two special characteristics to be aware of, which work to solve the problem.
 *
 * 1. This subclass stores at most only one state. The base class is designed to be able to store multiple states,
 *  but this is not supported in AndroidAPS. For this reason, several methods do not actually use their
 *  pumpAddress arguments. One example is the [hasPumpState] method.
 * 2. When AndroidAPS imports a configuration that was previously stored as an XML file, it calls plugin methods
 *  before and after the import was done. The ComboV2 driver uses this to restore an existing pump state. This is
 *  necessary, because importing a configuration wipes the values in the [sp] store.
 *
 * The second characteristic is why this subclass has the [createBackup] and [applyBackup] methods, as well as
 * the [hasAnyPumpState] method. When a configuration is imported, AndroidAPS calls the plugin class' method
 * mentioned earlier. In that method, the plugin uses [createBackup] to make a backup of the pump state.
 * During the import, the pump state is wiped. Once the import is done, another plugin method is called
 * by AndroidAPS. Inside that method, [applyBackup] is called to restore the previously pump state out of
 * the backup. The result is that the pump state remains intact. (If there is no pump state, then the
 * pre- and post-import methods do nothing of course.)
 *
 * Should the imported configuration contain its own pump state, the following logic is applied:
 *
 * If there is a pump state already, a backup is created as usual. Then, post-import, if there is a backup,
 * it will override the pump state that was imported from the configuration XML. If the imported configuration
 * contains a pump state, and there is no backup, then the pump state from the imported configuration is used.
 *
 * This logic, together with the one mentioned earlier, covers the following possible cases:
 *
 * 1. There is no pump state in the SP prior to the import, and there is none in the imported configuration.
 *   Nothing pump state related is done in this case.
 * 2. There is no pump state in the SP prior to the import, and there is one in the imported configuration.
 *   As mentioned above, no pump state backup is created prior to the import, and the pump state from the
 *   imported configuration is used instead.
 * 3. There is a pump state in the SP prior to the import, and there is none in the imported configuration.
 *   A pump state backup is created prior to the import, and it is restored once the import is done. This
 *   prevents the import from wiping the pump state.
 * 4. There is a pump state in the SP prior to the import, and there is one in the imported configuration.
 *   A pump state backup is created prior to the import, and it is restored once the import is done,
 *   overwriting the pump state from the imported configuration.
